# Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions

## Topological Space
A **topology** on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:

(1) $\varnothing$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$.

(2) The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in 
$\mathcal{T}$.

(3) The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of 
$\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

#### Definition
Suppose $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T'}$ are two topologies on a given set $X$. If $\mathcal{T'}\supset\mathcal{T}$, we say that $\mathcal{T'}$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$; if $\mathcal{T'}$ *properly* contains $\mathcal{T}$, we say that $\mathcal{T'}$ is *strictly finer* than $\mathcal{T}$. We also say that $\mathcal{T}$ is *coarser* than $\mathcal{T'}$, or *strictly coarser*, in these two respective situations. We say that $\mathcal{T}$ is comparable with $\mathcal{T'}$ if either $\mathcal{T'}\supset\mathcal{T}$ or $\mathcal{T}\supset\mathcal{T'}$.

## Basis for a Topology
If $X$ is a set, a **basis** for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ (called **basis elements**) such that 

(1) For each $x \in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$ containing $x$.

(2) If $X$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subset B_1 \cap B_2$.

### Lemma 13.1
Let $X$ be a set; let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$. Then $\mathcal{T}$ equals the set of all unions of elements of $\mathcal{B}$.

### Lemma 13.2
Let $X$ be a topological space. Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of open sets of $X$ such that for each open set $U$ of $X$ and each $x$ in $U$, there is an element $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C\subset U$. Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$.

### Lemma 13.3
Let $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B'}$ be bases for the topologies $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T'}$, respectively, on $X$. Then the following are equivalent 

(1) $\mathcal{T'}$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$

(2) For each $x \in X$ and each basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ containing
$x$, there is a basis element $B'\in\mathcal{B'}$ such that $x\in B'\subset B$.

#### Definition

If $\mathcal{B}$ the collection of all open intervals in the real line, $$(a,b) = \{x | a \lt x \lt b \} $$ the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is called the *standard topology* on the real line. Whenever we consider $\mathbb{R}$, we shall suppose it is given this topology unless we specifically state otherwise. If $\mathcal{B}'$ is the collection of all half-open intervals of the form $$ [a,b) = \{x | a\le x \lt b \} $$, the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}'$ is called the **lower limit topology** on $\mathbb{R}$ denoted $\mathbb{R}_\mathcal{l}$. Let $K$ denote all numbers of the form $1/n$, for $n\in\mathbb{Z}_+$, and let $\mathcal{B}''$ be the collection of all open intervals $(a,b)$, along with all sets of the form $(a,b)-K$. The topology generated by $\mathcal{B}''$ will be called the **K-topology** on $\mathbb{R}$ denoted by $\mathbb{R}_K$.

### Lemma 13.4
The topologies of $\mathbb{R}_\mathcal{l}$ and $\mathbb{R}_K$ are strictly finer than the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, but are not comparable with one another.

#### Definition
A **subbasis** $\mathcal{S}$ for a topology on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ whose union equals $X$. The *topology generated by the subbasis $\mathcal{S}$ is defined to be the collection $\mathcal{T}$ of all unions of finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$. 

## The Order Topology
Let $X$ be a set with a simple order relation; assume $X$ has more than one element. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of all sets of the following types:

(1) All open intervals $(a,b)$ in $X$.

(2) All intervals of the form $[a_0, b)$, where $a_0$ is the smallest element (if any) of $X$.

(3) All intervals of the form $(a, b_0]$, where $b_0$ is the largest element (if any) of $X$.

The collection $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, which is called the **order topology**.

#### Definition
If $X$ is an ordered set, and $a$ is an element of $X$, there are four subsets of $X$ that are called **rays** determined by $a$. They are the following: $$ (a, +\infty) = \{x|x \gt a\} $$ $$ (-\infty, a) = \{x|x \lt a\} $$ $$ [a, +\infty) = \{x|x \ge a\} $$ $$ (-\infty, a] = \{x|x \le a\} $$

## The Product Topology on $X \times Y$
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. The **product topology** on $X \times Y$ is the topology having as basis the collection $\mathcal{B}$ of all sets of the form $U \times V$ where $U$ is an open subset of $X$ and $V$ is an open subset of $Y$.

### Theorem 15.1
If $\mathbb{B}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$ and $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $Y$, then the collection $\mathcal{D}=\{B \times C|B \in \mathcal{B} , C \in \mathcal{C} \}$ is a basis for the topology of $X \times Y$.

#### Definition
Let $\pi_x:X \times Y \to X$ be defined by the equation $\pi_x(x, y)=x$ and $\pi_y:X \times Y \to Y$ by $\pi_y(x,y)=y$. The maps $\pi_x$ and $\pi_y$ are called the **projections** of $X \times Y$ onto $X$ and $Y$ respectively.

### Theorem 15.2
The collection $\mathcal{S}=\{\pi^{-1}_x(U)|U \in \mathcal{T}_X \} \cup \{\pi^{-1}_y(V)|V \in \mathcal{T}_Y \}$ is a subbasis of the product topology on $X \times Y$.

## The Subspace Topology
Let $X$ be a topological space with topology $\mathcal{T}_X$. If $Y$ is a subset of $X$, the collection $\mathcal{T}_Y=\{Y \cap U|U \in \mathcal{T}_X \}$ is a topology on $Y$, called the **subspace topology**. With this topology, $Y$ is called a **subspace** of $X$; its open sets consist of all intersections of open sets of $X$ with $Y$.

### Lemma 16.1
If $\mathcal{B}_X$ is a basis for the topology of $X$ then the collection $\mathcal{B}_Y=\{ B \cap Y|B \in \mathcal{B}_X \}$ is a basis for the subspace topology on $Y$.

### Lemma 16.2
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.

### Theorem 16.3
If $X$ is a subspace of $X$ and $B$ is a subspace of $Y$ , then the product topology on $A \times B$ is the same as the topology $A \times B$ inherits as a subspace of $X \times Y$.

### Theorem 16.4
Let $X$ be an ordered set in the order topology; let $Y$ be a subset of $X$ that is convex in $X$. Then the order topology on $Y$ is the same as the topology $Y$ inherits as a subspace of $X$.

## Closed Sets and Limit Points
A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be **closed** if the set $X - A$ is open.

### Theorem 17.1
Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the following conditions hold.

(1) $\varnothing$ and $X$ are closed.

(2) Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.

(3) Finite unions of closed sets are closed.

### Theorem 17.2
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. Then a set $X$ is closed in $Y$ if and only if it equals the intersection of a closed set of $X$. with $Y$.

### Theorem 17.3
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $A$ is closed in $Y$ and $Y$ is closed in $X$, then $X$ is closed in $X$. 

#### Close and Interior of a Set
Given a subset $A$ of a topological set $X$, the **interior** of $A$ is defined at the union of all open sets contained in $A$, and the **closure** of $A$ is defined as the intersection of all closed sets containing in $A$.

### Theorem 17.4
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$; let $A$ be a subset of $Y$; let $\bar A$ denote the closure of $A$ in $X$. Then the closure of $A$ in $Y$ equals $\bar A \cap Y$.
