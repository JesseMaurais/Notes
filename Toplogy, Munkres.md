# Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions

## Topological Space
A **topology** on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:

(1) $\varnothing$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$.

(2) The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in 
$\mathcal{T}$.

(3) The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of 
$\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

#### Definition
Suppose $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T'}$ are two topologies on a given set $X$. If $\mathcal{T'}\supset\mathcal{T}$, we say that $\mathcal{T'}$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$; if $\mathcal{T'}$ *properly* contains $\mathcal{T}$, we say that $\mathcal{T'}$ is *strictly finer* than $\mathcal{T}$. We also say that $\mathcal{T}$ is *coarser* than $\mathcal{T'}$, or *strictly coarser*, in these two respective situations. We say that $\mathcal{T}$ is comparable with $\mathcal{T'}$ if either $\mathcal{T'}\supset\mathcal{T}$ or $\mathcal{T}\supset\mathcal{T'}$.

## Basis for a Topology
If $X$ is a set, a **basis** for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ (called **basis elements**) such that 

(1) For each $x \in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$ containing $x$.

(2) If $X$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subset B_1 \cap B_2$.

### Lemma 13.1
Let $X$ be a set; let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$. Then $\mathcal{T}$ equals the set of all unions of elements of $\mathcal{B}$.

### Lemma 13.2
Let $X$ be a topological space. Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of open sets of $X$ such that for each open set $U$ of $X$ and each $x$ in $U$, there is an element $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C\subset U$. Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$.

### Lemma 13.3
Let $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B'}$ be bases for the topologies $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T'}$, respectively, on $X$. Then the following are equivalent 

(1) $\mathcal{T'}$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$

(2) For each $x \in X$ and each basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ containing
$x$, there is a basis element $B'\in\mathcal{B'}$ such that $x\in B'\subset B$.

#### Definition

If $\mathcal{B}$ the collection of all open intervals in the real line, $$(a,b) = \{x | a<x<b \}$$ the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is called the *standard topology* on the real line. Whenever we consider $\mathbb{R}$, we shall suppose it is given this topology unless we specifically state otherwise. If $\mathcal{B}'$ is the collection of all half-open intervals of the form $$ [a,b) = \{x | a\le x<b \} $$, the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}'$ is called the **lower limit topology** on $\mathbb{R}$ denoted $\mathbb{R}_\mathcal{l}$. Let $K$ denote all numbers of the form $1/n$, for $n\in\mathbb{Z}_+$, and let $\mathcal{B}''$ be the collection of all open intervals $(a,b)$, along with all sets of the form $(a,b)-K$. The topology generated by $\mathcal{B}''$ will be called the **K-topology** on $\mathbb{R}$ denoted by $\mathbb{R}_K$.
